## Part 1: Scrape Titles and Preview Text from Mars News
### 1.Use automated browsing to visit the Mars news siteLinks to an external site.. Inspect the page to identify which elements to scrape.
</br>

### 2. Create a Beautiful Soup object and use it to extract text elements from the website.
</br>

### 3. Extract the titles and preview text of the news articles that you scraped. Store the scraping results in Python data structures as follows:
#### - Store each title-and-preview pair in a Python dictionary and, give each dictionary two keys: title and preview. An example is the following:
#### - Store all the dictionaries in a Python list.
#### - Print the list in your notebook.
</br>
</br>

## Part 2: Scrape and Analyze Mars Weather Data
### 1.Use automated browsing to visit the Mars Temperature Data SiteLinks to an external site.. Inspect the page to identify which elements to scrape. Note that the URL is https://static.bc-edx.com/data/web/mars_facts/temperature.html.
</br>
</br>

### 2.Create a Beautiful Soup object and use it to scrape the data in the HTML table. Note that this can also be achieved by using the Pandas read_html function. However, use Beautiful Soup here to continue sharpening your web scraping skills.
</br>
</br>

### 3.Assemble the scraped data into a Pandas DataFrame. The columns should have the same headings as the table on the website. Hereâ€™s an explanation of the column headings:


####    -id: the identification number of a single transmission from the Curiosity rover
####    -terrestrial_date: the date on Earth
####    -sol: the number of elapsed sols (Martian days) since Curiosity landed on Mars
####    -ls: the solar longitude
####    -month: the Martian month
####    -min_temp: the minimum temperature, in Celsius, of a single Martian day (sol)
####    -pressure: The atmospheric pressure at Curiosity's location
</br>
</br>

### 4.Examine the data types that are currently associated with each column. If necessary, cast (or convert) the data to the appropriate datetime, int, or float data types.
</br>
</br>

### 5. Analyze your dataset by using Pandas functions to answer the following questions:

#### -How many months exist on Mars?
</br>

#### -How many Martian (and not Earth) days worth of data exist in the scraped dataset?
</br>

#### -What are the coldest and the warmest months on Mars (at the location of Curiosity)? To answer this question:
##### --Find the average minimum daily temperature for all of the months.
##### --Plot the results as a bar chart.
</br>

#### -Which months have the lowest and the highest atmospheric pressure on Mars? To answer this question:
##### --Find the average daily atmospheric pressure of all the months.
##### --Plot the results as a bar chart.
</br>

#### -About how many terrestrial (Earth) days exist in a Martian year? To answer this question:
##### --Consider how many days elapse on Earth in the time that Mars circles the Sun once.
##### --Visually estimate the result by plotting the daily minimum temperature.

</br>

### 6. Export the DataFrame to a CSV file.
